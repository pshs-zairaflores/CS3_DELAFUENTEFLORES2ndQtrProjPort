    <h3>Our Website</h3>
    <p>
      Water, Earth, Fire, Air. 20 years ago, Avatar: The Last Airbender was released on Nickelodeon. Almost 15 years later, this was released on Netflix, and two curious kids watched it. 5 years later, these same two kids created this website for fans like themselves— people who cannot forget about how good this show was.
      </p>
    <p>
        Due to how unforgettable Avatar: The Last Airbender was, we decided to create a website dedicated to our interpretations of the characters for this project. Featured on this website are also playlists dedicated to the main characters and a wall for fans like you to share your thoughts!
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks for reading, and have fun exploring the website!
